Ingredients:
 - 1 bag of microwaveable popcorn

Directions:
 1. Mush up and seperate the kernels inside the bag.

 2. Set the bag inside microwave and set it for about two minutes.

 3. Start the microwave and wait a few feet away from it.  Use this time to
    reflect on the usefulness of remote repositories.

 4. Stop the microwave when the "pops" occur about once every second. Open the
    bag and dump the contents into a large enough bowl. Add too much salt. Eat
    immediately.
